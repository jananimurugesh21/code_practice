|3|The Celebrity Problem| A celebrity is a person who is known to all but does not know anyone at a party. A party is being organized by some people. A square matrix mat[][] of size n*n is used to represent people at the party such that if an element of row i and column j is set to 1 it means ith person knows jth person. You need to return the index of the celebrity in the party, if the celebrity does not exist, return -1. |JAVA|<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/the-celebrity-problem/1?page=1&company=Zoho&sortBy=submissions">GFG</a>|<a href="https://github.com/jananimurugesh21/code_practice/blob/main/The%20Celebrity%20Problem">View Code</a>|
|4|Frequencies in a Limited Array| You are given an array arr[] containing positive integers. The elements in the array arr[] range from  1 to n (where n is the size of the array), and some numbers may be repeated or absent. Your have to count the frequency of all numbers in the range 1 to n and return an array of size n such that result[i] represents the frequency of the number i (1-based indexing). |JAVA|<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/frequency-of-array-elements-1587115620/1?page=1&company=Zoho&sortBy=submissions">GFG</a>|<a href="https://github.com/jananimurugesh21/code_practice/commit/9f61393ad3cac58e74f7e4b7d6c57d5bab8e9a50">View Code</a>|
|5|Permutation of a String| Given a string s, which may contain duplicate characters, your task is to generate and return an array of all unique permutations of the string. You can return your answer in any order.|JAVA|<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/permutations-of-a-given-string2041/1?page=1&company=Zoho&sortBy=submissions">GFG</a>|<a href="https://github.com/jananimurugesh21/code_practice/blob/main/Permutation%20of%20a%20String">View Code</a>|
